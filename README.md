## 🎉 Introduction

Evaluating how well machine learning models perform is vital. This collection provides a diverse set of metrics to analyze your models' effectiveness. By using these metrics, you can understand what your models do well and where they need improvement.

## 📈 Implemented Metrics

This collection currently covers three main types of tasks:

### [Regression Metrics](regression_metrics.ipynb)

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- R-squared (R2) Score
- Adjusted R-squared (R2) Score
- Pearson Correlation
- Spearman Correlation

### [Classification Metrics](classification_metrics.ipynb)

- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy Score
- Precision Score
- F-1 Score
- Recall Score
- Log Loss/Binary Cross Entropy Loss
- Area Under the ROC Curve (ROC AUC)
- Classification Report
- Average Precision
- Precision-Recall Curve

### [Clustering Metrics](clustering_metrics.ipynb)

- Silhouette Coefficient

### [Sequence Prediction Metrics](sequence_model_evaluation_metrics_nlp.ipynb)

- Word Error Rate
- BLEU Score
- Perplexity

These metrics cater to various evaluation needs across different machine learning domains. Each metric is transparent and can be customized if necessary.

## 🚀 Usage

To utilize these metrics:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ajitsingh98/All-About-Performance-Metrics.git
   ```
